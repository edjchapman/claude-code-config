## 🤔 Why This Exists

Claude Code stores configuration in `~/.claude/` (global) and `.claude/` (per-project). Keeping that consistent across projects and machines is tedious — agents get copied around, commands are duplicated, permission templates drift, and every new machine means manual setup.

This repo fixes that with **one canonical config** that everything else links back to:

- **Symlinks** so updates propagate everywhere automatically
- **Composable templates** for different project types
- **Hooks** for auto-formatting, safety checks, and notifications
- **Skills & rules** for passive domain knowledge and style enforcement
- **Setup scripts** that work on any machine

```mermaid

    set["settings.json"]

  subgraph Proj[".claude — per-project"]

    mcp[".mcp.json"]
  end
  repo -- "setup-global.sh<br/>(symlink)" --> Global
  repo -- "setup-project.sh<br/>(merge templates)" --> Proj
```

One repo links into every machine (global symlinks) and composes per-project permissions (template merge) — so a change here propagates everywhere instead of being copied around.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

There are two ways to consume this repo: as a **plugin** (recommended) or as a **symlinked global config** (legacy, still supported). Both modes coexist — hook paths use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIR:-<readlink fallback>}`, so they resolve either way.

### Option A — Plugin install (recommended)

```bash
# From inside Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add edjchapman/claude-code-config
/plugin install claude-code-config
```

> **How the name resolves:** there is no global plugin registry — `/plugin install` looks the name up only in marketplaces you have added, so after the `marketplace add` above it can only install from this repo. In the unlikely case another added marketplace also defines a `claude-code-config` plugin, use the scoped form: `/plugin install claude-code-config@claude-code-config` (`plugin@marketplace`).

Then add per-project permissions only:

```bash
cd ~/my-django-project
~/Development/claude-code-config/scripts/setup-project.sh django   # settings.local.json + .mcp.json
```

### Option B — Symlinked global config (legacy)

```bash
# 1. Clone (or fork to customize)
git clone https://github.com/edjchapman/claude-code-config.git ~/claude-code-config

# 2. Global config (symlinks into ~/.claude/)
~/Development/claude-code-config/scripts/setup-global.sh

# 3. Project config (from your project directory)
cd ~/my-django-project
~/Development/claude-code-config/scripts/setup-project.sh django

# 4. Start Claude Code — agents and skills are now available
claude
```

> **Tip — alias it.** Add `alias claude-setup='~/Development/claude-code-config/scripts/setup-project.sh'` to your shell profile, then run `claude-setup django react`.

### Fork or Clone?

| Approach  | When to use                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Clone** | Use as-is, or contribute improvements back    |
| **Fork**  | Customize agents/skills for your own workflow |

Forks can still pull upstream updates:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/edjchapman/claude-code-config.git
git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main
```

## 🧰 What's Inside

Everything falls into two modes — tools you **invoke** and tools that **auto-activate**:

|             | Active (you invoke)                             | Passive (auto-activates)                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What**    | Specialist agents, workflow skills, CLI scripts | Domain skills, rules, hooks                                                  |
| **How**     | `@name`, `/name`, or shell command              | Skills load by description; rules/hooks by file patterns or lifecycle events |
| **Example** | `@bug-resolver`, `/commit`, `daily-report.sh`   | `testing-patterns` loads when you write tests                                |

> Some capabilities are now handled by **bundled plugins** rather than custom artifacts: `/review` + `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` (code review), `feature-dev:code-architect` (implementation blueprints), `/security-review` (security audits).

### Agents

Invoke with `@agent-name`. **inherit** = follows your session model (deep-reasoning agents deserve whatever you're running); **sonnet** = deliberately pinned for pattern-based mechanical work (cost routing).

<details>
<summary><strong>8 specialist agents</strong> — click to expand</summary>

| Agent                   | What It Does                                                 | Model   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `@bug-resolver`         | Systematic debugging, root cause analysis                    | inherit |
| `@ci-debugger`          | CI/CD failure investigation, flaky tests                     | sonnet  |
| `@database-architect`   | Schema design, zero-downtime migrations, query optimization  | inherit |
| `@dependency-manager`   | Dependency audit, license checks, framework/version upgrades | sonnet  |
| `@devops-engineer`      | Infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, containers                  | inherit |
| `@documentation-writer` | README, API docs, ADRs, onboarding guides                    | sonnet  |
| `@performance-engineer` | Profiling, bottleneck analysis, optimization                 | inherit |
| `@test-engineer`        | Unit, integration, and Playwright E2E tests                  | sonnet  |

> **Provided by enabled plugins or bundled commands instead:** general code review (`pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer`, `feature-dev:code-reviewer`), spec/architecture (`feature-dev:code-architect`), simplification (`code-simplifier`), PR review bundling (`pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`), security audits (bundled `/security-review`), complex git operations (`git-workflow` skill). Custom versions were retired in favour of these — see [docs/extending.md](docs/extending.md) for the full retirement table.

</details>

### Workflow Skills

Invoke with `/<name>`. Custom commands were merged into skills upstream, so these live in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` alongside the domain skills (this repo's former `commands/` directory was migrated accordingly). Skills with a "Use when…" clause can also be auto-invoked by Claude from plain English (e.g. "commit my staged work" → `/commit`); user-only ones set `disable-model-invocation: true`. `/standup` and `/eow-review` can additionally be fired by a scheduled routine.

### Domain Skills

Domain knowledge Claude loads automatically based on the conversation — matched from each skill's `description:`, no explicit invocation needed. Skills use the nested layout `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

<details>
<summary><strong>9 domain skills</strong> — click to expand</summary>

</details>

### Rules

Path-scoped style enforcement (`paths` frontmatter). Skills provide patterns; rules enforce style.

<details>
<summary><strong>2 style rules</strong> — click to expand</summary>

| Rule               | Applies To            | What It Enforces                                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `python-style`     | `**/*.py`             | Naming, error handling, imports, type hints                              |
| `typescript-style` | `**/*.ts`, `**/*.tsx` | Naming, error handling, type usage, plus React-specific rules for `.tsx` |

</details>

### Hooks

Run automatically at lifecycle events. Configured in `settings.json` (symlinked globally, so active in all projects); scripts live in `scripts/hooks/` and only run when their tools are present (e.g. `ruff`, `prettier`).

<details>
<summary><strong>8 configured hooks + 3 opt-in</strong> — click to expand</summary>

**Opt-in** (each invokes an LLM on every fire, so all ship disabled — enable
deliberately; ready-to-paste snippets live in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)'s Hooks section):

| Hook             | Trigger                 | What It Would Do                                  |

| SubagentStop     | Before subagent returns | LLM-evaluated check: did subagent complete fully? |

</details>

### Scheduled Routines

Time-based workflows run themselves — two cloud routines (a daily standup prep and a Friday end-of-week review, created via `/schedule`, managed at [claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines)) fire the schedulable workflow skills and deliver each run as a comment on a pinned GitHub issue thread. Their schedules, delivery targets, and gotchas live in **one place** — [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)'s Automation section — alongside the **automation decision table** (command hooks vs prompt hooks vs routines vs `/loop` vs headless CLI scripts).

### Settings Templates

Composable permission sets merged into `settings.local.json`. `base` is always included; `deny` beats `allow` during merge.

### MCP Templates

MCP server configs generated alongside `settings.local.json` when a matching template exists.

<details>
<summary><strong>MCP server templates</strong> — click to expand</summary>

| Template  | MCP Servers                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `base`    | None (MCP is opt-in)                                 |
| `django`  | PostgreSQL (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres`) |
| `nextjs`  | PostgreSQL (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres`) |
| `fastapi` | PostgreSQL (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres`) |
| `python`  | SQLite (`mcp-server-sqlite-npx`)                     |
| `node`    | SQLite (`mcp-server-sqlite-npx`)                     |
| `aws`     | AWS IaC (`awslabs.aws-iac-mcp-server`, via `uvx`)    |

Web/DB frameworks (`django`, `nextjs`, `fastapi`) default to PostgreSQL; generic `python` and `node` use SQLite, since there's no shared external DB to assume. The remaining stacks (`go`, `rust`, `java`, `kubernetes`, `terraform`) fall through to `base.json` — add servers manually in the project's `.mcp.json` when needed. Playwright is a first-class plugin (`playwright@claude-plugins-official`), not an MCP template.

### Output Styles & Sandbox

<details>
<summary><strong>Output styles</strong> — set <code>outputStyle</code> or use <code>/output-style</code></summary>

This repo doesn't set a default — `outputStyle` is a personal preference.

| Style         | When to use                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`     | Standard task-focused responses                               |
| `explanatory` | Adds learning insights inline (good for unfamiliar codebases) |
| `learning`    | More guided; fewer one-shot answers (good for upskilling)     |

Set a default with `{ "outputStyle": "explanatory" }`, or switch on the fly via `/output-style explanatory`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Sandbox</strong> — ships disabled by default</summary>

Sandbox mode constrains Bash execution. It ships **disabled** so the baseline config doesn't change a user's security posture when symlinked into projects:

```json
"sandbox": { "enabled": false, "autoAllowBashIfSandboxed": false }
```

Opt in via local/per-project settings once you've confirmed the boundary is acceptable. `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed` reduces prompts inside sandboxed worktrees — enable deliberately; silent auto-approved Bash is exactly what shared configs should avoid.

### Tool depth layers

Some tools overlap intentionally at different depths:

```
Code review:     /review  →  feature-dev:code-reviewer  →  pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer  →  /ultrareview
                 (uncommitted)  (inline, filtered)         (pre-merge audit)                   (multi-agent cloud)

Reporting:       daily-report.sh  →  /standup  →  /eow-review
                 (headless)          (24h)        (full week)
```

### Common workflows

<details>
<summary><strong>Implement a feature</strong></summary>

```
feature-dev:code-architect    # 1. Implementation blueprint (plugin)
  (you write the code)         # 2. Implement
@test-engineer                 # 3. Write tests
/review                        # 4. Quick diff check
/commit → /pr                  # 5. Ship it
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Fix a bug</strong></summary>

```
@bug-resolver                  # Investigate root cause
  (you fix the code)           # Apply the fix
/review → /commit              # Quick check and commit
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Daily development cycle</strong></summary>

```
/standup                       # Generate standup notes
  (you work)                   # Write code
/review                        # Quick diff check before committing
/commit → /pr                  # Commit and open PR
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Review a PR</strong></summary>

```

review-pr.sh 142               # ...or headless: no interactive session
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>End-of-week reporting</strong></summary>

```

## 🔧 How Setup Works

### What gets created

**Global** (`setup-global.sh`) — symlinks in `~/.claude/`:

```
~/.claude/
├── agents          -> claude-code-config/agents
├── skills          -> claude-code-config/skills
├── rules           -> claude-code-config/rules
└── settings.json   -> claude-code-config/settings.json
```

**Project** (`setup-project.sh`) — in your project:

```
your-project/
├── .mcp.json                  # MCP server config (if applicable)
└── .claude/
    ├── agents              -> claude-code-config/agents
    ├── skills              -> claude-code-config/skills
    ├── rules               -> claude-code-config/rules
    └── settings.local.json    # generated from templates
```

### Settings files

- **`settings.json`** (global): plugin enablement, hooks, model selection — applies everywhere via the `~/.claude/` symlink. `setup-project.sh` does **not** create a per-project copy. A project may still commit its own `.claude/settings.json` for environment-specific hooks (e.g. the Claude-on-web bootstrap from `--tooling`); Claude layers project settings over global.
- **`settings.local.json`** (generated): permissions — which bash commands and tools Claude can use in your project.

### Project tooling (`--tooling`)

The Claude layer is symlinked so updates propagate. A project's **hard tooling** — a `make check` quality gate, validators, git hooks, CI workflows, a Claude-on-web bootstrap — can't be symlinked (GitHub Actions only runs workflows physically present in the repo). So `setup-project.sh <type> --tooling` **copies** (vendors) that layer in idempotently — existing files are never clobbered.

```bash
setup-project.sh python --tooling    # Claude layer + tooling layer
setup-project.sh --tooling           # tooling layer only
scripts/install-tooling.sh --hooks   # ...equivalently, the helper directly
```

| `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`, `.claude/settings.json` | **Claude-on-web bootstrap** — a `SessionStart` hook that stack-detects and installs deps when `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true` (a no-op locally), plus the committed settings that wire it. Commit both; keep them out of `.gitignore`. |

The payload lives in [`tooling/`](tooling/); [`scripts/install-tooling.sh`](scripts/install-tooling.sh) performs the copy. After install, wire your stack's lint/test into the Makefile's `stack-check` target — the installer prints a suggested snippet for your project type.

### Keeping settings in sync

```bash
cd ~/my-project
setup-project.sh --check django   # Check drift + symlinks
setup-project.sh django           # Regenerate if drifted
```

---

## 🎨 Customization

**Adding an agent** — create `agents/my-agent.md`:

```yaml
---
name: my-agent
description: Brief description for when Claude should use this agent
model: opus
---
## Instructions

Your detailed agent instructions here...
```

**Adding a skill or template** — the canonical recipes (with exemplar pointers) live in the **Self-Extension Guide** in [`docs/extending.md`](docs/extending.md). In short:

- Domain-knowledge skill → `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with `description: "<what>. Use when <trigger>."` (loaded by description)
- User-only workflow skill → same layout, plus `disable-model-invocation: true` (+ optional `argument-hint:`)
- Permission template → `settings-templates/<stack>.json` (`_source`, `_version`, `permissions.allow/deny`), then `setup-project.sh <stack>`

### Git setup for projects

Add the personal symlinks to your project's `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Claude Code symlinks (personal config)
.claude/agents
.claude/skills
.claude/rules
.claude/settings.json
```

**Do commit** `settings.local.json` if you want to share permissions with your team — the symlinks are personal, but the permission set is worth sharing.

### Uninstalling / cleanup

<details>
<summary><strong>Remove symlinks / move the repo</strong></summary>

```bash
# Remove global symlinks (~/.claude/commands only exists on older installs)
rm -f ~/.claude/agents ~/.claude/commands ~/.claude/skills ~/.claude/rules ~/.claude/settings.json

# Remove from a project (.claude/commands only exists on older installs)
rm -rf .claude/agents .claude/commands .claude/skills .claude/rules .claude/settings.json
rm .claude/settings.local.json   # optionally, generated permissions too

# After moving the repo, re-run setups to refresh symlinks
~/new-location/claude-code-config/scripts/setup-global.sh
cd ~/my-project && ~/new-location/claude-code-config/scripts/setup-project.sh django
```

</details>

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Common issues</strong></summary>

**Python not found**

```bash
python3 --version  # Need 3.8+
# macOS: brew install python@3.11   |   Ubuntu: sudo apt install python3
```

**Symlinks broken after moving the repo** — re-run both setups:

```bash
~/Development/claude-code-config/scripts/setup-global.sh
cd ~/my-project && ~/Development/claude-code-config/scripts/setup-project.sh django
```

**"Circular symlink" error** — you're running `setup-project.sh` from inside the config repo. Run it from your actual project directory instead.

</details>

---

## 📋 Requirements

- Bash shell (macOS, Linux, or WSL on Windows)
- Python 3.8+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code)

**Windows:** these scripts need a Unix-like environment. Use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (recommended) and run scripts from within it; Git Bash may work but is untested. Note that symlinks created in WSL aren't visible to native Windows apps.
